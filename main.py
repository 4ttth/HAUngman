HAUngman is a basic python game script that is based off the traditional game 'Hangman'.
HAUngman is specifically inclined for Holy Angel University's dictionary
HAUngman also offers a text-based multiplayer command-line that can range from many players!
HAUngman offers 3 different singleplayer modes:
1) HAU without hint
2) HAU with hint
3) Regular dictionary (500 words)

This code is open-source, feel free to edit, fork, or repo.
